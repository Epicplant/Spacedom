            There are more stars in our universe than grains of sand in all of Earth's deserts
            and on all of its beaches. There are more than 200 billion stars in the Milky
            Way galaxy alone, 10% of which are similar to the Sun. Nearly a fifth of those
            Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized plant in the "habitable zone", meaning there are
            an estimated 4 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy. That number balloons to
            40 billion if you include planets orbiting red dwarfs. The closest one? That would
            be Proxima Centauri b, which orbits the closest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri,
            a mere 4.2 light-years away. If you were traveling at the speed of the
            fastest-moving manmade object (the Parker Solar Probe), an amazing 68.6 km/s,
            it would still take 18,500 years to get there. So close, yet so far.

        <p>
          There are far too many interesting facts about space than humanly possible to list.
          However, we have chosen a few as can be seen below. To learn a lot more, you could always

            <p>One of the most terrifying phenomenons in the universe is the neutron star.
              A neutron star is one of the densist known astral objects, resulting in it
              having a gravitational pull almost comparable to a black hole and is made almost
              Furthermore, it emits an extreme amount of a radiation making a neutron star
              a massive threat to any living being coming near. </p></div>

            <p>A nebula is a massive patch of gas or space dust concentrated together allowing for
              the creation of some of the universes most striking images. Stars
              typically originate in nebulas and can honestly be credited as the
              cause of almost every solar system making nebulas both beuatiful, and inspiring.</p>
